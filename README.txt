DOCUMENTATION:
    This game is Master Smasher, a time trial/survival type game where the
    user must survive ten minutes of high-risk, fuel-starved escaping. The
    player has stolen a top-secret government vehicle and is on the run.
    The United States government will not let their valuable tech get away
    easily. However, the tank you've stolen is the first of its kind: an 
    extremely durable, bouncy smash machine. You'll need to smash into the 
    overhead vehicles by bouncing off their bombs. With each government
    vehicle smashed, you gain funds. Every 30 seconds, you'll need a fill
    up, and it'll cost.

    Some features of this first checkpoint are enemy and player NPCs that
    are smooth. The sky also has moving clouds that coincide with the
    direction of the player's motion. The player tank has suspension that's
    bouncing up and down with the motion, and all four of its wheels spin.
    The enemy helicopters have spinner propellers.
